# New site starter template 2021
Use this template for starting all new sites. This has updated jQuery, leanModal and some new ADA accessiblity features that affect screenreaders and keyboard navigation. 

Page templates have pages created for:
- home page / index.html
- meet the dentist / meet-the-dentists.html
- main services / services.html
- service page / implants.html
- contact / contact.html
    - this contains contact, appt form, doctor's landing section, generic tour gallery, smile gallery, faq, basic form, & video grid

When uploading the site to CMS remove all commented out scripts or css not being used.

Always add this variable to the body so pages can be be targeted with specific class instead of just page title for custom styling
```
$section(page-type)$ 
```
